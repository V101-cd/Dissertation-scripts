Being able to click into packets to expand fields with more info","More complex display filters seem difficult to create. I couldn't work out how to filter by packet type, destination address, and port at the same time.
Everything feels cramped. The RFC-style display was hard to scroll around and work out what was what.","Easier to use/understand/write display filters (it crashed when I tried this)
A summary of the number of packets which fit a certain display filter when you've filtered by it (e.g. filter by arp, it would display 8 somewhere)"

5 reordered,Agree,1891,8,20:7b:d2:c7:04:f4,IPV4,1,3,,Hop-By-Hop,TCP,4,,,,,I liked being able to filter the packets by protocol. I liked the colour coding and the extra info in the packet scroll window such as info and length. ,Information overload in some parts. I struggled to pull out information I wasn't familiar with as it felt less intuative. ,Have a setting that reduces the amount of information such as not showing the Frame infor and Ethernet info as most of this task was looking at protocols at a higher level.

7,Agree,1891,7,20:7b:d2:c7:04:f4,,,,,,,,,,,,The color coding is nice. The packet stats in the bottom right is useful.,"The UI is wild, like the size of the drop down menus just vary too much. It's hard to look through the details of each packet. It feels very cramped. The icons don't make intuitive sense.",It needs a UI overhaul. The methods to change the UI layout are completely unintuitive. It also needs better icons that show their functionality more closely. The data needs to be labelled a displayed better.

Fewer features overall made it easier to use the features that were present.
Pretty graphs are fun.","Couldn't scroll on images in the streams page
Couldn't filter the packets in the main display of packets. I had to manually cross-reference between the different screens.
Everything is very visually similar. It's a little tedious scrolling through an abyss of grey packets.","Whenever a packet number is displayed, make it a link to that packet. It would make it much easier to work out stuff about the packets that are being referenced.
More info about packets than just the number in the main display (so I can quickly get very basic information)."

I liked the diagrams showing the frames broken down. ,It's not immediately clear just from the home screen what protocol each packet is. No filtering.

There needs to be a bit more information about each packet on the main page. Packets need to be sortable by number on the streams page.

,,Neither agree nor disagree,Strongly disagree,"Hmm. Packets are difficult because there are so many of them. With all the different connections between different packets in different ways, it might be cool to view packets in some sort of immersive 3D VR experience. 2D tools like Wireshark and your tool are always just slightly too small for what I want to do. With an extra dimension, different streams etc. could be at different heights in the VR environment.",FIN handshakes as well as SYN (with diagrams maybe?),Wireshark is cluttered...,,Note: amended from raw data because participant confused Tool 1 and Tool 2.,,,,,,,,,,
,,Strongly disagree,Agree,"From [our tool], the visualisation of the data being similar to the diagram presentation of packets as they are seen in most textbooks greatly improved its readability",colour coding based on protocol and search funcitonality from [Wireshark] that made it faster to be able to sort groups of packets in the list,no,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Agree,Disagree,"More on general graph usage, [our tool] had these and [Wireshark] did not","ability to send packets through, i.e. netstat discover command -> e.g. send arps to all devices on network, etc","[Our tool]: the main screen, number of packet + something else to show, e.g. protocol, nicer at a glance",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,"more firendly ui, headings and colours that make it easy to separte and pick out information",n/a,clearer signposting and navigation,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,Strongly disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,"[Wireshark] had dropdown capability in the packet visualization, however, it's text based visualization was clumsy. I would like [our tool]'s more diagramatic visualization but with the drop down capability of [Wireshark] at the same time. For example being able to collapse/expand the header diagram visuals. ",[Wireshark]'s filter strategies helped me navigate things more quickly. But [our tool] did have some helpful summaries for each type of packet. I would maybe have a way to filter and compare multiple types of packets at once. Say TCP and UDP were both selected and both types of packets and summaries for them could be displayed side by side.,n/a,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Strongly disagree,Strongly disagree,"Packet diagrams, more interactable  (changable scales, zoons [zoom into graphs], etc.)","Simple overall statistic counts in the bottom right (packet counts, types, etc. mke it very customisable) ","Making the system more interactive, having clear divisions of data, making sure that related information is as close as possible to each other. Linking packets where they are listed to the detailed individual packet breakdown. Hover over keywords in breakdown to provide info about what it does and it's value.  Keep it customisable in scale and shape.",,,,,,,,,,,,
